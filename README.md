Syntax highlighting for Labelled BNF, a [variant of
BNF][reference] used in the compiler [construction tool
bnfc](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/).

Based on the vim script available at
<http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1470>. The script was extended
with support for most of the syntax described in the LBNF [reference].
